    <p>The World Buddhist Museum in Kandy is a notable museum located in Kandy, Sri Lanka. However, as of my last knowledge update in September 2021, there was no specific information available about a "World Buddhist Museum" in Kandy. It's possible that the museum may have been established or renamed after that time.</p>
    <p>In general, Kandy is a city renowned for its rich Buddhist heritage and cultural significance. It is home to the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), which is one of the most sacred sites for Buddhists around the world. The temple houses the relic of the tooth of the Buddha, and it attracts many pilgrims and tourists.</p>
    <p>Kandy also hosts the Esala Perahera, a grand annual festival where a sacred tooth relic casket is paraded through the streets, accompanied by traditional music, dance, and beautifully adorned elephants. The city's historical and cultural importance, combined with its scenic beauty, makes it a popular destination for both local and international visitors.</p>
    <p>If the World Buddhist Museum in Kandy does indeed exist or if there have been updates since my knowledge cutoff, I apologize for any information gaps. It would be best to consult up-to-date resources or contact local tourist information centers in Kandy for the most accurate and current information about the museum.</p>
