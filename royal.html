    <p>The Royal Botanical Gardens in Kandy, Sri Lanka, is another significant botanical garden that shares the "Royal Botanical Gardens" name. Also known as Peradeniya Botanical Gardens, it is situated about 5.5 kilometers west of the city of Kandy.</p>
    <p>The Royal Botanical Gardens in Kandy were established in 1821 by the British colonial rulers during the time of the Kandyan Kingdom. It covers an expansive area of around 147 acres (59.5 hectares) and is renowned for its diverse collection of plants, exquisite landscapes, and historical significance.</p>
    <p>The gardens showcase a remarkable variety of flora, including towering trees, colorful flowers, and a wide range of tropical plants. Visitors can explore themed gardens, such as the Orchid House, Spice Garden, Palm Avenue, and the stunning Royal Palm Avenue, which features a double row of royal palm trees.</p>
    <p>One of the highlights of the Royal Botanical Gardens in Kandy is the enormous Javan Fig Tree (Ficus benjamina). This colossal tree spreads its branches over a large area, creating a captivating canopy under which visitors can wander.</p>
    <p>In addition to its botanical attractions, the gardens offer a serene environment for leisurely walks, picnics, and enjoying nature. The nearby Mahaweli River adds to the scenic beauty of the surroundings.</p>
