  <div class="my-div">
    <p>Kandy Lake, also known as the Kiri Muhuda or the Sea of Milk, is a scenic man-made lake located in the heart of Kandy, Sri Lanka. It is one of the most iconic landmarks in the city and a popular tourist attraction.</p>
    <p>The lake was built in 1807 by the last Sinhalese king of Kandy, Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe. Its purpose was to enhance the beauty of the nearby Temple of the Tooth, which houses the sacred tooth relic of the Buddha. The lake covers an area of approximately 65 acres and is surrounded by lush greenery and picturesque landscapes.</p>
    <p>The Kandy Lake is not only a beautiful spot for tourists but also serves as a recreational area for locals. It offers a peaceful ambiance, and visitors can take leisurely walks along the paved pathways that encircle the lake. There is also a small island called "Kiri Samudra" (Milk Sea) located in the middle of the lake, which adds to its charm.</p>
    <p>One of the highlights of the lake is the stunning view it provides of the Temple of the Tooth. The temple is located on the northern side of the lake and is an important pilgrimage site for Buddhists. During the annual Esala Perahera festival, a grand procession takes place, and the tusker carrying the sacred tooth relic walks alongside the lake, creating a magnificent spectacle.
