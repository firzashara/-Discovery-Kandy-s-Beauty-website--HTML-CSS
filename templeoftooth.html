  <div class="my-div">
 <p>The Temple of the Tooth Relic, also known as Sri Dalada Maligawa, is a significant Buddhist temple located in Kandy, Sri Lanka. It houses the sacred tooth relic of Lord Buddha, which is considered one of the most revered Buddhist relics in the world.</p>
  <p>The temple has a long and rich history dating back to the 4th century CE when the tooth relic was brought to Sri Lanka from India. Over the centuries, it has been the target of invasions and attacks by various foreign powers due to its religious and cultural importance. However, it has been rebuilt and restored multiple times.</p>
  <p>The temple complex is beautifully designed and showcases impressive architecture, with intricate carvings, colorful paintings, and stunning decorations. The main shrine chamber, where the tooth relic is enshrined, is the most sacred area of the temple. The relic is kept within a golden casket, which is then enshrined within several nested caskets representing different layers of protection.</p>
  <p>The temple is not only a place of worship but also a significant pilgrimage site for Buddhists from around the world. It attracts thousands of visitors each year, who come to pay their respects, make offerings, and participate in religious ceremonies.

    One of the most prominent ceremonies held at the Temple of the Tooth Relic is the Esala Perahera, a grand procession that takes place annually in Kandy during the months of July or August. The procession features traditional dancers, drummers, beautifully adorned elephants, and a replica of the tooth relic casket, parading through the streets to honor the sacred relic.</p></div>
